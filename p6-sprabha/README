Project description: A Playable Game

The easiest part of this project: Adding Sound. Creating God Mode.

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
I did not have any major problems. But it took a lot of time to complete everything that I wanted. Restricting the player was challenging.
I had problem recording both the game sound and the video. I tried a lot of tools like avconv, ffmpeg and kdenlive. But could not combine the audio and video files and also speed it upso that I get it less than 20s. I ended up doing a 42s video.

Project Explaination:
Goku on Nimbus, is trying to collect all the 7 dragonballs. The dragon balls are located at each intervals. I have locked the movement of Goku in the Y-direction. Whenever Goku destroys an enemy, the Y-direction limiter moves forward, and he is able to collect the dragon ball. I have given God Mode functionality by pressing 'G' on the keyboard. In god mode, all the limiters except for the last one is removed and you can collect all the dragon balls. 'SpaceBar' is for shooting the enemies. Once all the 7 dragon balls are collected, you can press the 'Return' (i.e., Enter key) key on the keyboard to summon Shenron the dragon to get your wishes granted. You can restart the game at any time by pressing 'R' key on the keyboard.
I have added Player and Enemy health, painter's algorithm along with sounds. I have given player restriction. And background change.
I have left the valor (moltress) sprites as Dr. Malloy asked me to leave them there, when I went to talk to him few days before the project 5 submission.
In the painter's algorithm, I did not feel the need to draw the crows layer by layer as the crows are always on the sky and I did not want few of them to go behind the first or the 2nd layer. But I did scale them and gave them velocities based on their size.
Instead of just counting the number of dragon balls collected and displaying text on the screen, I am drawing image of the dragon ball collected (with the star) on the top right of the screen.
Finally, I have make the game in such a way that, once you go to God Mode all the enemies are dead and all the limiters except for the last one is lifted. Even after you come back from the God Mode, the enemies are all dead.
