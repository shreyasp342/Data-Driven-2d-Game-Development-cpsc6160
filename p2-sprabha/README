Project description: Drawing with SDL 2.0

The easiest part of this project: Initial Setup of Creating the Window and getting premitives to work

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
	1. I found out the hard way of the limitations of SDL_RenderFillRect, as the rectangle that can be created using SDL_RenderDrawRect or SDL_RenderFillRect should always be parallel to x and y - axes. And most of the rectangles in my BiCycle drawing were at an angle to the axes.
	2. Filling the Triangle that I have used for the bicycle seat was also a problem.
	3. I had a bit of problem with the overloaded output operator as well. Declaring it outside the class or using the friend keyword worked.
	4. Declaring the PI and Deg2RAD variables within in the class (in public or private) gave me segmentation faults, so I had to declare it globally.
	5. Had trouble getting back and passing the renderer and window pointers from my Draw class to the FrameFrnerator class. I was getting a completely black image in frames folder.So I ended up creating a function in my Draw class and using the FrameGenerator object in that class to create my .bmp file.
