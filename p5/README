Project description: Adding a Player, Display HUD, Collision Detection and AI

The easiest part of this project: Everything was pretty strainght forward. 

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
1. Getting the Goku flying on Nimbus sprite. I ended up getting a gif from web, extract the frames from the gif and then create a sprite sheet from it.
2. Creating HUD was little time consuming.
3. The sprite class was bounded within the (0,worldWidth) and (0,worldHeight). And the smartSprite class inherits this sprite class. But when the smartSprite (dragonBall) is within the safe distance from the player, the smartSprite kept going out of bounds. I think it  used to go till (0-safeDistance,worldWidth+safeDistance) and (0-safeDistance,worldHeight+safeDistance).

Possible Final Project:
I plan to have a game built around the original dragon ball series. In this game, I intend to have kid goku on his nimbus goes on a dragon ball hunting quest. There are 7 dragon balls in all. I plan to have some obstacles along the way( Still haven't decided what they are going to be). The dragon balls are located far apart from each other. The game finishes when Kid Goku collects all 7 dragon ball. Maybe have an animation where Shendron comes when the game ends.
