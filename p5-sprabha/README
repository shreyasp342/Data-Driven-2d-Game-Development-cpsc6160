Project description: Object Pooling, Explosions, and Projectiles

The easiest part of this project: Creating an explosion using the chunking example.

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
1. When I try to explode both the sprites/characters when collided, the chunks created also trigger explosion as soon as the character re-appers.
2. Struggled a bit when trying to explode the sprite after the energy ball collides with it. I was trying to call the detach and delete immediately after calling the explode function, not giving enough time of the animation to take place. So, I ended up using a flag to delete the sprite after the explosion animation is completed.
3. Struggled with implementing shooting and pooling. It took me a lot of time to implement them. Struggled a bit with the hierachy.

Project Explaination:
Goku on Nimbus, is trying to collect all the 7 dragonballs. The dragon balls are smartsprites trying to get away from Goku. The dragon balls explodes when goku collects it. The dragonballs count reduces after all the chunks of the dragon ball disappears. The player (Goku) explodes when he colloides with valor (moltres) and reappears again after the explosion animation. Pressing F1 brings up 2 HUDs - 1. The information HUD and 2. The object pooling HUD which shows the size of free list and bullet list. The projectiles are energy balls. When the spacebar is pressed, Goku shoots energy balls. These energy balls when collided with the bicycle triggers the explosion of bicycle.
