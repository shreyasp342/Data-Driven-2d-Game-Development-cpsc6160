Project description: Tracking a Sprite

The easiest part of this project: Most part except for parallax scrolling and two-way MultiSprite. Video made it easy.

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
1. Deciding on the Sprites for characters (objects) and background.
2. Editing the sprites like extracting from the sprite sheet, changing their background (for transparency) and stitching them back together.
3. Converting the gif to png images and then to sprite sheet.
